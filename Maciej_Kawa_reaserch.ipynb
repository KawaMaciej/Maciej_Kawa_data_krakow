    "collected data This algorythm produces luckluster rusults. Proposed solution was to make diffrent predictions per sector. As seen on figure below 2nd sector and 3rd sector have simillar influence. Therefore division to three sectors does not seem beneficial enough to justify creating 3 models and lessening access to bigger pool of data for 2nd and 3rd sector. It is advisable to divide data into two parts, 1st sectors and ther others. Then creating linear regression or another regression model for each invidual part seems like the best solution to this problem."

    "The metrics are pointing for XGBoost regressor to be the best model, because of the lowest values of errors and the biggest R-squared, but it is the most vulnerable to new data. Random forrest regressor seems to be more robust to new data while achieving simillar metrics results to XGBoost model, but both of them lack interpretability of linear regression. In my opinion slightly worse scores of linear regression are not enough to lose that interpretability of model, which could clearly show which area of delivery could lead to improving delivery times. In this case looking at the coeficient of linear regression for driver_id we can see that there is clear diffrence in delivery times fo each driver. The diffrence may be influenced by the experience of invidual driver."
